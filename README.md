# Predict Smart Meters Next Non-Communicative date

Smart meters are used for billing of electricity, gas, water, and heat for residential, commercial, and production sites. The technological advancements in these smart meters are being driven by the demand from utility companies to create a smarter and more efficient grid aimed at reducing non-revenue losses. However, these smart meters have challenges to maintain and identifying problems.
#### Identifying Faults/ Maintenance Challenges
Smart meters go non-communicative for many reasons which include an excess of electric energy measurement, under voltage of battery, communication failure, timing error, abnormal display, and burnout, and weather, etc.  In addition, meters stops working for a while and does so every now and then with increasing frequency. Eventually, it produces periods of zero consumption in the data. When the meter does not communicate it not only data loss, it leads to inaccurate billing, more maintenance trip to fixing, and unhappy customers.
Once a certain percentage of faults occur in the running process of smart meter, the electric company will make statistics of the fault information to grade the severity of the situation and release operation risk warning to fix it. On that basis they carry on the follow-up analysis. However, this process requests high requirements of fault phenomenon confirmation, positioning, and the technical ability and experience of classification technical personnel.
#### Solution Approach
Development of standardized smart meter fault classification and fault information statistical process, especially, the development of automatic sorting device aiming at automatic fault diagnosis and sorting for the removed smart meters through the fault diagnosis and fault table sorting technique, is an important method to solve the problem. 
Predictive analytics helps us a lot on this one. One of the many opportunities it can provide is predicting the next non-communicative day of the smart meter. What if you know if a smart meter is likely to go offline and victim for data loss in next 15 days.  The objective is to predict whether the meter could fail earlier than it actually fails. Machine Learning model to predict when the smart meter will go non-communicative that leads in-person checking is essential to save cost. 
We can build our strategy on top of that and come up with lots of tactical actions like: When fixing the other permanently stopped meters, service men could validate nearby potential failure meters as
